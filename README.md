# WeatherApp
This web app uses Open Weather Map API to get weather info by taking the city ID from the user
The app returns the weather data and sends them to the server with user data provided by the user as a user story by a post request
The app finally makes a get request to the server to get the latest info and updates the user interface

This app uses express, body-parser, cors
makes get and post requests
any works asynchronously using promises
